        <p2>Okay. So… You went to the <a href="#">rodeo</a> last week right? And it’s an annual thing?</p2>

        <p>Yeah! The <a href="#">rodeo</a> I went to was the Fort Worth Stock Show and <a href="#">Rodeo</a>. Texas is <i>full</i> of different types of <a href="#">rodeo</a>.</p>

        <p2>What type of <a href="#">rodeo</a> would you classify this one as? I didn’t realize they had <i>types</i>.</p2>

        <p>So like, this particular <a href="#">rodeo</a> lasts about 2-3 weeks. The stock show part is for ranchers to show off their animals, cattle and pigs and all that, for prize money. <br><br><br>The actual <a href="#">rodeo</a> part is a series of competitions. One show is about 4 hours long and is usually made up of a bunch of categories:</p><br><br><br><br><br>

        <p8>Bull Riding,</p8>
        <p3>calf roping,</p3>
        <p4>barrel racing,</p4>
        <p5>steer wrestling,</p5>
        <p6>bareback riding, </p6>
        <p7> and saddle bronc. </p7>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>Those show get quite a few world champions. <br><br> I was lucky enough to see them perform. Even if most of them lost <b>haha</b> it really comes down to tenths of a second!</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <p2>Okay well first i have to ask because I’m dumb - what is saddle bronc?</p2>

        <p>Okay so, saddle bronc has the same vibes as bull riding, but it’s riding a bronco with a saddle, as opposed to like bareback riding. They have these weird rules about where to place your spurs during the bucking and the ornerier the horse, the more points you get.</p>

        <p2><b>OOOHH.</b> I know what you’re talking about now.</p2>

        <p>YEAH. And all the ridings or whatever you wanna call them, they just have to stay on the animal for 8 seconds. If the rider falls off before then, they’re disqualified.</p>

        <p2>See 8 seconds feels really short but I know as soon as I got on one of those things I’d eat dirt IMmEDIATELY.</p2>

        <p>You and me BOTH. When you’re watching the show, it feels like the longest 8 seconds. Even the world champion they talked up fell of his horse 2 seconds in.</p>

        <p2><b>Geeeez</b> that’s like no time at all. But yeah it definitely seems like one of those things where time slows down because those horses can be NAsTy.</p2>

        <p>Yeah it’s a dangerous sport! If you can call it a sport… But it’s been around just as long as most popular sports.</p>

        <p2>It’s a cowboy sport. The <a href="#">Rodeo</a> is just… cowboy olympics… wow. <br><br><br>See I have vague memories of going to a <a href="#">rodeo</a> but also we just don’t have as much of that stuff in New York. Mostly just like show jumping at fairs and stuff.</p2>

        <p>Cowboy olympics. I love it. <br><br><br> I mean, this <a href="#">rodeo's</a> slogan is “This Thing is Legendary”............ considering the stadium has been around since 1894 <br><br> and hosted the same show every year it might as well BE the olympics down here. <br><br><br><br><a href="#">Rodeos</a> are so… ingrained in everyone’s lives here. <br><br><br><br> In high school i volunteered at a small town <a href="#">rodeo</a> every year for the volunteer points. <br><br> But you see those pictures and they aren’t exaggerating. <i>EVERYONE’s</i> wearing cowboy hats, cowboy boots, Levi jeans, those extra buckles.</p>

        <p2>See I couldn’t even imagine getting volunteer points for helping at a <a href="#">rodeo</a> up here that’s crazy hahaha. <br><br><br> I still can’t believe that <a href="#">rodeo</a> has been around since 1894 though, that’s like peak cowboy era… sort of. <br><br>It’s just so funny seeing that “modern” cowboy look it just feels so out of PlACe where I’m from.</p2>

        <p>Yeah, I can imagine! <br><br> I don’t even own a pair of cowboy boots myself. I am a heathen.
            <br><br><br>But for a lot of people here, that’s still their way of life... Sure they’ve got some modern technology, but they’ve still got real cowboys on horses with lassos to keep the bulls in line and such. But yeah! My senior high school trip was to New York City and half the people complained it was “too much city.” </p>

        <p2>I feel like the east coast equivalent of that is all the Amish communities who still use a horse and buggy to get around. <br><br><br> There are a few roads up where my grandmother lives that still have those horse riding and tractor road signs but that’s more of just a farm thing I think.</p2>

        <br><br><br>

        <p>We’re NOT THAT BAD At least. Oh my god, but that’s funny too. Living in two different time periods here… except for the Amish I guess.</p>
        
        <p2>No the Amish are definitely an extreme hahaha. Now I’m just picturing a cowboy churning butter… </p2>
